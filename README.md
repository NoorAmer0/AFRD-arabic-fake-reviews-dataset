## Description
Arabic Fake Reviews Detection (AFRD) is the first gold-standard dataset comprised of three domains, namely, hotel, restaurant, and product domains. Each domain has a set of attributes, the reviewer’s age, the reviewer’s gender, the service name, the review’s text, the rating, the text’s polarity, and the review’s class. The overall balanced dataset is consisted of 1728 reviews, 310 reviews for the hotel domain, 714 reviews for the restaurant domain, and 704 reviews for the product domain, the two classes in each domain are balanced. However, there are unbalanced version. The following table demonstrate the number of reviews in each class for the balanced dataset:

| Domain      | Fake class | Truthful class | Total   |
|-------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Hotel 	    | 155        | 155            | 310     |
| Restaurant  | 357        | 357            | 714     |
| Product 	  | 352        | 352            | 704     |
| Multi-doain | 864        | 864            | 1728    |
